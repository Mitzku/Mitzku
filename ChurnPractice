A streaming video startup is interested in measuring their user churn rate. In this project, youâ€™ll be helping them answer 
these questions about their churn:

1. Get familiar with the company.
 
How many months has the company been operating? Which months do you have enough information to calculate a churn rate?
What segments of users exist?


 Select *
 From subscriptions
 Limit 100;
 
 
 Select Distinct segment
 From subscriptions;
 
Select Min(subscription_start), Max(subscription_start)
From subscriptions;



2. What is the overall churn trend since the company started? Compare the churn rates between user segments.
